Prefetch Dumper

This is a command line tool allowing one to dump the content of windows prefetch files on linux.
This is work in progress, however, the forensic value of the software is still good enough.
So far, one can see the following:
 - Signature
 - File length
 - Executable name
 - Path hash
 - Last execution
 - Run count
 - File metrics: i'm not quite sure about those values

The rest will come in time, hopefully after i'm done with my fucking exams
